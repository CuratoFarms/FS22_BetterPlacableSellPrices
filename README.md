# FS22_BetterPlacableSellPrices
his script gives the player better prices when selling a placeable.   There is a grace period of 1 month when placing/selling a placeable.   If the placeable is sold within 1 month you will get 100% of the placeable cost back.   After 1 month the price will reduce to 80% of cost and then reduce every month after that (like base game).   You will not be refunded landscaping costs.    Credit to loki_79 for scripting help.
